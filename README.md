## Status

This app was built in two days as a pair programming challenge. It is only currently working for mobile resolution. We had a short timeline to finish the project but I felt really happy at the result of our app that we created. 


### Ideas for Future Enhancements:

- I wanted to make it responsive and expand it for tablet, laptop and desktop view.
- I wanted to change the dice and add features such as animations to the car movements.


## Inspiration

My inspiration for this app was that I always wanted to make some sort of game. My partner and I were brainstorming a bunch of ideas and this one seemed like the most fun and practically one.
